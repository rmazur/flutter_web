If you've never run a desktop build before, you will need to enable it with a one-time command for your current platform:

flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

Check you're existing devices with:

flutter devices


Then you're ready to run the app:

flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d linux
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d web
